PythonStarz Class notes

Each student signs up for a student github account --> https://education.github.com/

then get a pack -> https://education.github.com/pack

ROUGH beginning outline/draft/notes for club/class

https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/35417301-pythonstarz

12 week ‘terms’?
Meet weekly

Go over definitions/concepts
Emphasis on working Together (Colaboration outside of class as well as in it)

everyone on github (pythonstarz class)
dedicated gitter or discord chat
put up a class website?


Some quotes that give idea of the class ‘themes’

“Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.”

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." 

“First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack.”

“Three virtues of great programmers: laziness, impatience, and hubris.”

“To iterate is human, to recurse divine.”

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." 

Unstated goals - "Sneaky" teaching
    Lesson plans will be about use cases of Python
    
    Real plan is to teach:

Independent learning/thinking/researching

True coder workflow

Code colaboration

Github

Leadership and cooperation

Teambuilding

Each student building a portfolio as well as thinking computationally and problemsolving
	
    
    
Inflict perfection – peer review – code programming -USMC standards

an intro to Python 
– brouchures
- things you can do
- why python
- best language to learn?

----------KEEP ON TRACK devise system to keep class on the rails (ideas → Use Cloud9? TBD)

Class – go over previous weeks assignments/homework
            -presentations, peer reviews
	this weeks definitions and examples
	homework for next weeks class
	In class coderbyte.com 15 minute python problems


Intro

Why?
Simplistic High level language Very powerful
Python3 the future
Python2 the past
best language out there?
----what can you do with python?
Examples
	perfect intersection of most paid, most growing, and easiest to learn
	easy? Super simple syntax
	Made as an example for kids to learn computer concepts
	was so put together evolved into a main language (NASA)
	Data science, NASA, AI, Amazon, web development, Youtube, Instagram, Spotify
	frameworks – django, flask, web development
	machine learning
	any recommendation systems (Amazon, Netflix etc)
	web development? Data analysis?
	A LOT of data – visualize, make meaning out of it
	help you visualize math
	
PYTHON community – awesome

Code reviews
Pair programming

principles
3 day project paradigm
pick a small project
- web crawler (scrape a site)
Day 1
 	Basic functionality
	Learn basics Python
	make mistakes
	mess around
Day 2
	Complete functionality
	Refactor
eliminate bugs (all)
Day 3
	Documentation
	Refactor
	Push to online repo
	packaging etc (completion)
Day 4 
	No touchy


Put on resume/github for each student

stack overflow
	use it
	-decorators
	-generators

common stumbling blocks to watch out for
	-everything is an object (seriously)
	-learn to refactor, refactor to learn
	


challenge 
	use mock to write pure unit tests
	

	

Goals of the class explain peer review/pair programming

-----Homework – print function and strings






















Think like a programmer

Data Types & Variables 
This lesson teaches students how to store and recall different types of data. Students are taught how and when to use numbers, strings, and booleans as well as naming rules for variables.

Functions  
Students learn how to define their own functions so that they can execute multiple actions at one time. In addition, students review different methods to call those functions throughout their code.


If/Else Statements & Relational Operators  
In this lesson students learn how to write conditional based statements to control when their functions execute. Students are taught multiple operators to create a broad range of conditions.

Loops  
Students discover how to code more efficiently and with minimal code by using loops. In addition, the class is taught to simplify existing code while still maintaining language integrity.

Arrays  
In this lesson students learn how to store and recall multiple pieces of data by using arrays. By adding on to previous lessons, students discover how to easily access and utilize this data within loops.

Logical Operators  
This lesson increases students ability to write more complex logic within their functions. Students will be able to create and link multiple condition requirements allowing them to do more with a single function.


Return Statements  
Students learn different methods of obtaining user input and storing it within their code. In addition, the class learns how to use this data to trigger different actions within the same function.

Arithmetic Operators  
While adding on to existing lessons, students learn the full range of Arithmetic Operators including *,/, and %. Students learn how to utilize these operators to enhance function logic.

Math Functions  
Students learn some enhanced logic available in most programming languages. The class works with generating random numbers, rounding numbers, and utilizing the these functions to expand the ability of loops and arrays.

Wrap up
	Small teams BIG ideas
	class has worked together to tackle the fundamentals of Computer Science using Python
	through peer review and pair programming have uitlized teamwork, leadership and cooperation
	you all ARE a small team
	Some of the biggest companies in the world were started by small teams with BIG ideas
	Python lets any team use Powerful tools
	Go change the world
